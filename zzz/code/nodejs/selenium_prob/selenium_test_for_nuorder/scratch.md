# Todo.

1. Get a gulp system to work.
2. Get 1 test to work.
3. Try to aim for a headless test system. (Semaphone chrome)
4. Have some command line option to allow you to point to that directory.
5. Determinne what test you want.
6. Maybe provide a VM?



# To think of.

1. Pure webdriverio approach.
2. Do i asusme that the server is up? (I think I do. I should not assume anything.)
3. Some config system to point to the url.
4. Visual regression testing.



# You probably need

A bash script or anisble script to install java.
Or some note about it



# bash script
sudo apt-get install -y default-jdk

need to install the browsers



# instruction notes

selenium standalone start?
I think this needs to be a global



# chrome install
